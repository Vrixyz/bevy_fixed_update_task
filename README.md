# Bevy fixed update task

Bevy's fixed update is throttled by rendering, but it doesnÂ´t have to be!

This crate allows you to run a fixed update in a background task,
so you can improve your time budget.

[Read more about it.](docs/physics_timestep_loop.md)

## How it works

:warning: this crate makes most sense when using bevy's `multi_threaded` feature. Otherwise, this just adds unnecessary overhead.

It's quite similar to how bevy's fixed update works, but eagerly extracts ECS data into a background task, to synchronize it only when we exceed `Time<Virtual>` + its accumulated time.

The implementation doesn't use `Time<Fixed>` but a component approach `TimeStep`, `SubstepCount`, `TaskToRender`.

By relying on scheduling for extracting data and writing back, it's easier to order systems correctly when using other ecosystem crates such as `bevy_transform_interpolation`.

Unfortunately mermaid has a few bugs and github doesn't rely on latest mermaid, you can paste that is https://mermaid.live for a better formatting:
